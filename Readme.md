# Logging Examples

This repository contains the source code and presentation for a talk about Structured Logging using [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) and [Seq](https://datalust.co/seq).

## CafeDemo.sln

This set of code was provided by Nicholas Blumhardt at Datalust, the company behind Seq. It contains two applications for loading sample data into Seq. LoadCafeDataSet will load a set of data as quickly as possible into a database. LoadLiveCafeDataSet will load events over time, to simulate an actual running application.

## LoggingExamples.sln

Contains several examples demonstrating different concepts in unstructured and structured logging, with a focus on using Serilog library.

## StructuredLogging.pptx

Microsoft PowerPoint presentation covering what structured logging is and explaining some of the benefits of using it with Serilog and Seq.
